# Momentix


Momentix is a free alarm clock application designed to create, edit and remove alarms in the easiest way. You can use Momentix to wake up in the morning or set up reminders for your tasks during the day.
You can also edit or remove alarms with just one touch, saving a lot of time when you need to set up your alarms.

If you use Momentix to wake you up in the morning, you will be able to wake up gently from your dreams, in a peaceful and progressive way, because Momentix increases alarm volume slowly instead of starting at maximum volume. This way, you can avoid being startled by a loud sound while you are in a deep sleep.

Momentix lets you customize the alarm's sound (selecting any ringtone, sound or song in your phone) and many other settings.

If you want to wake up at the same time every day, on workdays, weekends or just a few days a week, you can easily select which days when creating the alarm, and the alarm clock will go off on that selected days every wee
